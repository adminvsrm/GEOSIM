## Drawing the ‘15-minute City’ Bubble: Crowd simulation to detect the size of community-life circle in New York City

The recent uptake of  ’15-minute city’ planning ideas sought after by cities around the world (Weng et al. 2019, Pozoukidou and Chatziyiannaki 2021) refers to the idea that all residents can access most of their daily needs (e.g., groceries, work, education, shopping, health, exercise, entertainment, etc.) within 15 minutes (up to 20 minutes), commuting from their own doorsteps by walking, cycling, or public transportation. This notion has been sharply discussed lately during the Covid-19 pandemic, as the pandemic has significantly restricted human movement, forcing people to stay at home and only go out for basic needs (Dinah Lewis Boucher, 2020). Thus, ushering in a new era of integrated urban fabric which combines most of residents’ life essentials to each local community is promoted. 

However, when the concept of '15-minute city' and the history of urban inequity (Duncan et al. 2012,  Douglas S.Massey 2001) encounter, challenges of implementing the idea arise and the challenges could vary from different countries in different places (Feargus O'Sullivan, 2021). For example, people who stay in New York may be able to gain most of their daily needs within 15-minute traveling, while people who live in the small and midsized cities may require more time to get their essentials. So, 

  - What is the size of a 15-minute city or a community-life bubble (which is referred to as ‘the bubble’ in the remainder of the paper) within a travel distance of 15 minutes by different traveling modes (e.g., walking, cycling, etc.)? 
  - How much the size of bubble varies between different places? 
  - How is the expanding rate of the bubble size when people traveling during the 15 minutes? 
  - Does the expanding rate drop dramatically or retain increasing after 15 minutes? If the expanding rate reach plateau before 15 minutes, does that mean residents can get their needs in a smaller area? 
  - What could be the potential factors that affect the size of the bubble? 
  
The benchmark of quantifying a 15-minute city has not come with a consensus in the current state-of-the-art. It is at this junction, we spatiotemporally simulate residential movement on streets from the bottom-up by developing an agent-based model to quantitatively draw the bubble of a city. In this study, we take New York City as the case study and apply the model to the five boroughs. We hope the study could be helpful for detecting the flexibility of defining a ’15-minute city’ and for investigating the potential factors that affect its definition.
