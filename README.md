## Drawing the ‘15-minute City’ Bubble: Crowd simulation to detect the size of local community-life circle in New York City

<div style="text-align: justify">The recent uptake of  ’15-minute city’ planning ideas sought after by cities around the world (Weng et al. 2019, Pozoukidou and Chatziyiannaki 2021) refers to the idea that all residents can access most of their daily needs (e.g., groceries, work, education, shopping, health, exercise, entertainment, etc.) within 15 minutes (up to 20 minutes), commuting from their own doorsteps by walking, cycling, or public transportation. This notion has been sharply discussed lately during the Covid-19 pandemic, as the pandemic has significantly restricted human movement, forcing people to stay at home and only go out for basic needs (Dinah Lewis Boucher, 2020). Thus, ushering in a new era of integrated urban fabric which combines most of residents’ life essentials to each local community is promoted.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">However, when taking the history of urban inequity (Duncan et al. 2012, Stephens 2012) into account, challenges of implementing the concept of ‘15-minute city’ arise and the challenges could vary from different countries in different places. For instance, people who stay in New York City may be able to gain most of their daily needs within 15-minute traveling, while people who live in the small and midsized cities may require more time to get their essentials, especially where there is a lack of public transports. So, </div>

  - what is the exact size of a 15-minute city? 
  - How much does the size vary from diverse traveling modes (e.g., walking, cycling, or driving)? 
  - How much does the size fluctuate between different places within a city or across countries? 
  - Does the size reach a plateau before 15 minutes of traveling? 
  - If it does, does that indicates people could obtain their essentials in a shorter distance? 
  

<div style="text-align: justify">The benchmark of quantifying a 15-minute city has not come with a consensus in the current state-of-the-art. In order to quantitatively draw the size of a 15-minute city, I spatiotemporally simulate residential movements on streets by developing an Agent-Based Model (ABM). I hope the bottom-up approach introduced in this study could help detect the flexibility of defining a ‘15-minute city’ and thereafter help investigate the underlying factors that affect its definition. The model is put to the test in application to a 4 by 4-kilometer square neighbourhood in Queens, which is located in the easternmost of New York. According to NY.gov, Queens is the largest in the area and the second-most in the population of the five boroughs of New York City, known for its diverse culture and diversified economy, and attracts people all over the world. It might be interesting to reimagine what the neighbourhood could look like in this ‘cornucopia’ as a 15-minute city model. </div>
